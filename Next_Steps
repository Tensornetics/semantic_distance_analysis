# Next Steps #

```
The rest of the repository would likely include additional files and directories that are necessary for the package to function properly.

The package's source code would be in a directory called src or semantic_distance_analysis.
It would contains all the necessary code files such as semantic_distance.py which contains the main function that is used to compute the semantic distance, and any other modules or classes that are needed by that function.

There could be a directory called tests where the package tests are located, which test the correctness and functionality of the implemented code in the package.
It would include test files such as test_semantic_distance.py that test the semantic_distance function.

A data directory can also be there, that might contain data sets or resources used by the package such as pre-trained models, lexical resources or any other data used by the package.

Finally, a docs directory could be there to provide documentation, API reference, and usage examples. It could contain documentation in the form of a website generated using a tool like Sphinx.

It is worth noting that the structure of the repository could be different based on the development methodologies, frameworks and tools used and the requirements of the package.
